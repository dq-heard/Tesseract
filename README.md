# Tesseract
This is my first Python project (but it's had many incarnations and remixes). Another long, ongoing endeavor in the early stages of my developer journey. I had to cut it down by a lot since I found myself trying to build a mini Final Fantasy at times, but I've finally gotten it to a complete, mostly bug-free state that I'm happy with for now.
